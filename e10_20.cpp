// Exercise 10.20: The library defines an algorithm named count_if. Like
// find_if, this function takes a pair of iterators denoting an input range and
// a predicate that it applies to each element in the given range. count_if
// returns a count of how often the predicate is true. Use count_if to rewrite
// the portion of our program that counted how many words are greater than
// length 6.
